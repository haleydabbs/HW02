Starcatcher!

Everyone knows that you can wish on a shooting star,
but in order to maximize the likelihood that your wishes
come true, you should wish on the luckiest number of
stars possible (7 of course).

Use the left and right keys to move your starcatcher
across the bottom of the screen. Try to catch the
shooting stars as they pass you by. When you catch them,
they should appear in your very scientific star storage
box in the bottom right of the screen. Once you catch 7
stars, you win the game (and a wish)!
